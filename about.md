I am a third year Computer Science Distinguished Doctoral Fellow at the University of Arkansas studying Fair and Private Federated Learning in the Non-IID Setting. As of October 2021, I have been working with Dr. Xintao Wu in the Social Awareness and Intelligent Learning lab. My free time is spent playing with my two cats (Miso and Tofu), reading new adult fiction, working on a slowely progressing novel, and watching Formula 1. </p>
