    <h2>Language Learning</h2>
    I was very lucky to be able to start learning Mandarin Chinese while I was in high school. I quickly fell in love with the language and culture, so much so that I decided to complete a minor in Chinese during my undergraduate years. I also had the opportunity to study abroad at Hangzhou Normal University (杭州师范大学) in Summer 2017. I keep up with my skills by watching shows like Mo Dao Zu Shi (魔道祖师) and A Bright World (世界青年说), listening to podcasts such as Talk to Me in Chinese(聊聊东西), and using websites like <a href="https://www.hackchinese.com/collaborations">Hack Chinese</a>. FYI：我的中文名字孔爱霞。很高兴认识你！
    
    I have also dabbled with other languages such as ASL, Swedish (Hallå), Russian (Привет), Korean (안녕하세요), and Japanese (こんにちは). I hope to become fluent in some (maybe all?) of these one day.
