Almost all data statistics and analysis tasks fundamentally depend on a basic understanding of the distribution of the data. Local differential privacy (LDP) is proposed as a distributed variant of [Differential Privacy](https://alycia-noel.com/intro-to-dp/) which achieves privacy guarantees for each user locally and is independent of any assumptions on the third party servers. It has been used for tasks like frequency and mean value estimation, heavy hitters discovery, $k$ -way marginal release, empirical risk minimization, federated learning, and deep learning. 

#### :information_source: **Definition: $\epsilon$ -Differential Privacy**
A randomized mechanism $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\epsilon$ - LDP if and only if for any pairs of input values $v, v'$ in the domain of $\mathcal{M}$ , and for any possible output $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ , it holds

<p align="center">
  $\frac{\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{M}(v) = y]}{\mathbb{P}[\mathcal{M}(v') = y]} \leq e^{\epsilon}$
</p>

where $\mathbb{P}[\cdot]$ denotes probability and $\epsilon$ is the privacy budget. A smaller $\epsilon$ means stronger privacy protection, and vice versa. 

#### :information_source: **Theorem: Sequential Composition**
Let $\mathcal{M}^i(v)$ be an $\epsilon^i$ -LDP algorithm on an input value $v$, and $\mathcal{M}(v)$ is the sequential composition of $\mathcal{M}^1(v)$, $\dots$ , $\mathcal{M}^m(v)$ . Then $\mathcal{M}(v)$ satisfies $\epsilon^1 + \dots + \epsilon^m$ -LDP. 

## Randomized Response
Randomized response was originally a surveying technique but it has been adopted as the default technique to implement LDP. Users who possess a private answer $x$ flips it with probability $p$ of giving the true answer and probability $1-p$ of giving the false answer. Randomized response achieves LDP by providing plausible deniability for the response of a user and users no longer need to trust the central server to protect their data as it is perturbed before being aggregated.
